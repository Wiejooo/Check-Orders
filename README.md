# Check-Orders
A simple program for my colleague to check his work orders faster. Built with Tkinter.
## Description
The program is based on displaying a list of order numbers. Then, by entering a single order number, the program checks if it is on the list. Finally, the program will show which orders have not yet been entered (not settled).

The program is in use by my colleague thanks to the PyInstaller library.
